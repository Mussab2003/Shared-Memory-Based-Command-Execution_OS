# Shared-Memory-Based-Command-Execution_OS

Efficient Linux command execution using concurrency, multithreading, multiprocessing, and shared memory.<br><br>
– Programming Language: C using POSIX API

– An Operating Systems project utilizing shared memory and interprocess communication for executing Linux com-
mands efficiently. The project consist of a producer, consumer and standby program. Producer employs multi-
threading to read commands into shared memory, while Consumer uses multiprocessing and multithreading for
retrieval and execution. Standby serves as a fail-safe, creating new processes on failure. Demonstrates proficiency
in C programming, concurrent processing, and system-level design principles.
