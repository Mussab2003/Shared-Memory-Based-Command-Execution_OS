<h1>Shared-Memory-Based-Command-Execution_OS</h1>

<p>Efficient Linux command execution using concurrency, multithreading, multiprocessing, and shared memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming Language: C using POSIX API</li>

<li>An Operating Systems project utilizing shared memory and interprocess communication for executing Linux com-
mands efficiently. The project consist of a producer, consumer and standby program. Producer employs multi-
threading to read commands into shared memory, while Consumer uses multiprocessing and multithreading for
retrieval and execution. Standby serves as a fail-safe, creating new processes on failure. Demonstrates proficiency
in C programming, concurrent processing, and system-level design principles.
